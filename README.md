**Automatically squash changes back into historical commits where they belong.**

git-autosquash is a powerful tool that analyzes your working directory changes and automatically distributes them back to the commits where those code sections were last modified. Instead of creating noisy "fix lint errors", "cleanup tests", or "address review feedback" commits, it uses git blame analysis to intelligently squash improvements back into their logical historical commits.

![git-autosquash Interactive TUI](screenshots/readme/hero_screenshot.png)

**Perfect for common scenarios like**: You've been working on a feature branch and now need to fix lint errors, test failures, or code review feedback. Rather than committing all fixes into a final "cleanup" commit, git-autosquash lets you push each fix back to the original commit that introduced the issue, maintaining clean and logical git history.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üéØ Smart Targeting**: Uses git blame to find the exact commits where code was last modified
- **üíª Interactive TUI**: Rich terminal interface with syntax-highlighted diff viewer  
- **üõ°Ô∏è Safety First**: Default unapproved state with user confirmation for all changes
- **üîß Conflict Resolution**: Clear guidance when merge conflicts occur during rebase
- **üìä Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback with detailed commit summaries
- **‚Ü©Ô∏è Rollback Support**: Full git reflog integration for easy recovery

### Feature Demonstrations

<details>
<summary>üéØ Smart Targeting with Git Blame Analysis</summary>

![Smart Targeting](screenshots/readme/feature_smart_targeting.png)

git-autosquash analyzes git blame to understand exactly which commits last modified each line of code, providing high-confidence targeting for your changes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üíª Interactive Terminal Interface</summary>

![Interactive TUI](screenshots/readme/feature_interactive_tui.png)

Full keyboard navigation with syntax highlighting, real-time previews, and intuitive controls make reviewing changes efficient and clear.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üõ°Ô∏è Safety-First Approach</summary>

![Safety First](screenshots/readme/feature_safety_first.png)

All changes start unapproved by default. Full git reflog integration and backup creation ensure you can always recover if something goes wrong.
</details>

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Recommended: Install with uv (fastest, modern Python package manager)
uv tool install git-autosquash

# Or with pipx for isolated environment
pipx install git-autosquash

# Or with pip
pip install git-autosquash
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Make some changes to your code
vim src/auth.py src/ui.py

# Run git-autosquash to organize changes
git-autosquash

# Review proposed changes in the TUI, approve what makes sense
# Changes are automatically squashed into their target commits!
```

## üìù Workflow Example

Here's what a typical git-autosquash session looks like:

### Before: Messy History
![Before Traditional Approach](screenshots/readme/comparison_before_traditional.png)

### The git-autosquash Process

1. **Check Status** - See what changes need organizing
![Workflow Step 1](screenshots/readme/workflow_step_01.png)

2. **Launch Analysis** - git-autosquash analyzes your changes
![Workflow Step 2](screenshots/readme/workflow_step_02.png)

3. **Review Results** - See confidence levels and proposed targets
![Workflow Step 3](screenshots/readme/workflow_step_03.png)

4. **Interactive Review** - Approve or modify the suggestions
![Workflow Step 4](screenshots/readme/workflow_step_04.png)

5. **Execute Changes** - Watch the rebase happen safely
![Workflow Step 5](screenshots/readme/workflow_step_05.png)

6. **Clean History** - Enjoy your organized git log
![Workflow Step 6](screenshots/readme/workflow_step_06.png)

### After: Clean History
![After git-autosquash](screenshots/readme/comparison_after_autosquash.png)

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Analysis**: Parses your working directory changes into structured hunks
2. **Blame Investigation**: Uses `git blame` to find which commits last modified each line
3. **Target Resolution**: Applies frequency-based algorithm to select target commits with confidence scoring
4. **Interactive Review**: Presents findings in rich TUI with confidence indicators and diff previews
5. **Safe Execution**: Performs interactive rebase only on user-approved changes with full backup support

### Handling Edge Cases

git-autosquash gracefully handles complex scenarios:

<details>
<summary>üÜï New Files Without History</summary>

![New File Fallback](screenshots/readme/fallback_new_file_fallback.png)

When files have no git blame history, git-autosquash offers intelligent fallback options based on recent commits and similar files.
</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ùì Ambiguous Blame Results</summary>

![Ambiguous Blame](screenshots/readme/fallback_ambiguous_blame_fallback.png)

When multiple commits could be valid targets, you get clear options to choose the most appropriate one.
</details>

<details>
<summary>‚úèÔ∏è Manual Override Capability</summary>

![Manual Override](screenshots/readme/fallback_manual_override.png)

Sometimes you know better than the algorithm - easily override suggestions when you have the full context.
</details>

## üéØ Use Cases

### Perfect for:
- **Bug fixes during feature work** - Squash fixes back into original implementations
- **Code review feedback** - Distribute improvements to their logical commits
- **Refactoring sessions** - Integrate optimizations with original code
- **Documentation updates** - Keep docs synchronized with code changes
- **Lint and test fixes** - Clean up CI failures without polluting history
- **Security patches** - Apply security fixes to the vulnerable code commits

### Example: Code Review Workflow
```bash
# After addressing review feedback across multiple files
git-autosquash

# TUI automatically maps:
# - Security fix ‚Üí Original security implementation commit
# - Performance improvement ‚Üí Original algorithm commit  
# - Documentation update ‚Üí Original feature commit
# - New functionality ‚Üí Remains as new commits

# Result: Clean history where each commit tells complete story
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command-Line Options

```bash
git-autosquash [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --line-by-line    Use line-by-line hunk splitting for maximum precision
  --version         Show version information
  --help           Show help message
```

### Precision Modes

- **Standard**: Uses git's default hunk boundaries (faster, good for most cases)
- **Line-by-line**: Analyzes each changed line individually (slower, maximum precision)
